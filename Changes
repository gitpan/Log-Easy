01.01 - trial run, apparently there is little mercy for incorectly packaged module uploads
01.02 - try again, added some documentation, fixed failing tests
01.03 - adjusted dist layout
01.04 - dist layout was still "wrong", try again
01.05 - ?
01.06 - ?
01.07 - fixed problem with pad() and space() where it failed to get an appropriate length for the fill character if the fill character was a zero `0'
